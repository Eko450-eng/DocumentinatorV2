# Documentinator
Make your physical documents searchable [Live web version](https://documentinator.vercel.app/).

## What is it for
Documentinator is a small little Project I started working on aimed for people that have to keep some of their paperwork as physical copies for example tax related documents and contracts.

## How does it work?
Documentinators core is pretty simple:
1. Create an account
2. Create a folder (Referencing one that you have physically)
3. Inside your folder you enter the names, dates and categories of the documents that you have inside of each folder.
( For both folders and files you can change the location, this comes in helpfull for example when you gave a document or folder to a relative or an agency or moved it to another place like a new shelf or file cabinet )
4. That's it, whenever you need a certain file you don't need to search through all your folders for hours anymor - Simply search in the interface for whatever you are looking for, and then you will know where you put it.
